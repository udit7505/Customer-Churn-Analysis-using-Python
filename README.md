# Customer-Churn-Analysis-using-Python
The provided notebook contains an analysis focused on customer churn, specifically analyzing contracts and their impact on churn likelihood. Hereâ€™s an executive summary based on the content and the included visualizations:
Executive Summary:
This analysis investigates customer churn patterns with a particular focus on contract types. The findings are supported by visual charts and data exploration from the customer dataset.

1. Churn vs. Contract Type:

A countplot visualizes the distribution of customers by contract type (Month-to-month, 1-year, and 2-year) with respect to churn.
Key Insight: Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts (1-year or 2-year). This suggests that shorter commitments may lead to higher churn rates, likely due to the ease of cancellation.
2. Feature Exploration:

The analysis covers multiple customer features such as contract type, payment method, and tenure, among others. This exploration helps in identifying key factors contributing to churn.
3. Actionable Insights:

Customer Retention Strategies: The insights recommend focusing on month-to-month contract holders for churn reduction strategies, such as offering discounts or incentives for longer-term contracts.
Tailored Marketing: Companies could also tailor their marketing and retention efforts to specific customer segments based on their contract type.
